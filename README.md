# Real-Time Chat Application (Under Development)

Welcome to my Real-Time Chat Application GitHub repository! This project is currently under development. It utilizes the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack to create a real-time chat application where users can communicate with each other seamlessly.

## Features (Planned)

- **Real-Time Communication**: Users will be able to send and receive messages instantly without refreshing the page, thanks to the WebSocket protocol.
- **User Authentication**: A secure user authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will ensure that only authenticated users can access the chat.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work flawlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Message History**: Users will be able to view previous messages in the chat history.
- **Profile Customization**: Users will have the option to customize their profiles with avatars and other information.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing user information, chat messages, and other relevant data.
- **Express.js**: Backend web application framework for Node.js, used for building the RESTful API.
- **React.js**: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for creating the interactive chat interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side scripting.
- **Socket.IO**: JavaScript library for real-time web applications, used for enabling real-time communication between clients and the server.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Authentication mechanism used for securing user authentication.
